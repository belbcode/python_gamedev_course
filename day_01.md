What is a computer?
A computer is a machine that can read a set of instructions and modify those instructions. In modern computing these instructions are written in binary, the zeros and ones most commonly seen in movies when somebody is 'hacking into the mainframe'. Binary is the only language a computer understands, this is because a computer (CPU) is comprised of millions to billions of microscopic electrical devices called 'transistors'. When a transistor has an electrical current going through it, the computer registers that as a 1, if there is no electrical current, it registers as a 0. The 2 possible options is why its called "binary". The transistor serves as the basis for modern computing. A binary gate or transistors that outputs either a 1 or a 0 is called a bit. 8 of these bits make up a byte. The one from kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte. You can argue that all a computer really does is manipulate data. The words you read on an online article or the movie you watch on your phone or even video games are just a human legible side-effects of the computer serving 1s and 0s.
There are many components that make up a computer. Some important components are: The CPU (central processing unit) which reads and executes (processes) instructions, its the brain of the computer. RAM stands for (Random Access Memory). RAM is where the computer stores information that is currently being used. RAM is very fast and easy for the CPU to access. On the contrary, the Hard Drive is where the computer stores data in the long term. Data from the Hard Drive is significanlty slower to access than RAM memory. Think of RAM as short-term memory, the information that's relevant to what your doing right now. How to use a computer, listening comprehension, etc. The Hard Drive is more long-term memory, what you had for breakfast today, how to ride a bike. When hard drive data needs to be accessed it gets loaded into the RAM for the CPU to use.

What is a programming language?
As I mentioned before, a computer can only read 0s and 1s. This makes it very complicated for a human to interface with a computer. Humans can learn to speak in binary, but the process is clumsy and unintuitive. Due to this major bottleneck to working on computers, early computer scientists devised a way to simplify the act of producing binary instructions. The first programming languages: COBOL, FORTRAN, Assembly- -were born of this endevor. They would package a set of binary instructions that had a function (let's say adding one value to another value) and linked it to a human legible syntax (let's say "+"), and voila! You now have an addition operator! Of course this is a gross simplification, the designers had to also handle the messy logic of how human legible input environments would be implemented and a bunch more stuff I probably haven't thought about. I think you could see how this creates a positive feedback loop of functionality. The first programming languages were made by the process of modulating functions in binary instruction into a human readable format and used the new modular (context) (functionality) to create more refined functions. A toolmaker using his tools to make better tools. Or to make a modern (Minecraft) analogy: Mining stone with a wooden pickaxe so you can build a stone pickaxe. The process of encapsulating logic and repackaging it to be more ledgible and easier to access is the most fundamental principle in computer programming. And you will do it to.

What is Python?
Python is one of those 'refined' tools I just talked about. Python is a programming language that was released in 1991. Old by some standards but it has been continually modified and updated till today. The current stable version is Python 3.10.5. Python is known as a "interpretted" programming language, this means it doesn't actually interface with the hardware of the computer **THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS**. Instead Python code is executed in a virtual environment known as the python interpretter. The virtual environment does communicate with hardware but the endpoint of a python script is ultimately software and so that one step of seperation from the hardware is what deems it as "interpretted". As opposed to compiled, but I won't get into that at the moment.

How to set up Python:
(This is bare bones because it will just be demonstrated live)
You can install Python by going to their website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and pressing the big yellow button that says "Download Python 3.10.5" it should recognize which OS (Operating System, we didn't even get into that) you are using but if not there should be an option on the page to download the version supported by your OS. After it downloads open the installer and begin the process of installing Python. Make sure that when it prompts you, you check the "Add Python to PATH" option on the installer. This makes it so that you can access Python from your computer Terminal segueing us into.
